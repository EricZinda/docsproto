## Simple Commands (without prepositions)
"delete the file" is straightforward except for pron
"delete every file": what to do if one of the files cannot be deleted?
    Best: do it transacted?
    Next: do it until we fail?
"delete the folder": maybe needs a planner to delete files first and then folder?
"describe the file" ditto except for how to print?

We will simply print out when something happens instead of doing it to avoid bugs ruining things.

Not sure if this is really necessary: Need to motivate why to implement special index variants of verbs
