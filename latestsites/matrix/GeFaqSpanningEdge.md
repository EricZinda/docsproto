## How do I tell if I have an edge that spans the whole chart?

First, look at the [parse chart](GeFaqShowChart).

Then:

- Scroll all the way to the right, and look to see if there is an edge
which is labeled as spanning position 0 (the beginning of the
sentence) to n, where n is the number of words in the sentence. (The
first thing in an edge label is information about the portion of the
string it spans.)
- Alternatively, click on each of the words (at the far left edge of
the chart) until they are all highlighted. Then scroll to the right
to see if any edges are highlighted. An edge that spans the whole
chart wil be.
