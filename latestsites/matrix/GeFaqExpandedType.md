## How do I see what a type looks like with all of the constraints it inherits from super types?

From the LKB Top menu, select "View &gt; Expanded type..." and enter the
type name. Alternatively, from a window displaying a feature structure
or a type hierarchy, click on a type name and select "Expanded type"
from the pop-up menu.
