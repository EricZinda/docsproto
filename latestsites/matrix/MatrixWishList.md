# Overview

To experiment with a more discussion-style exchange among Matrix
developers and consumers, this page may serve for people to post
questions, wishes, proposals for change, and answers.

- It would be very nice to have a default download (or two) with
everything filled out. Something like an extra button with "Insert
sample choices for Japanese" (or possibly even some other language).
This would allow people to play with a sample grammar without having
to fill out several pages of forms.
