{% raw %}# Russian Questions Grammar

The grammar started as a development grammar for the [Grammar
Matrix](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/matrix/MatrixTop) constituent questions library. It covers simple and
embedded intransitive and transitive clauses, both propositional and
interrogative (both polar and constituent). It has a minimal lexicon at
this point. The [test
suite](https://students.washington.edu/olzama/rus.txt) is in Cyrillic
font and consists of 294 sentences. A version which also covers
ditransitive clauses exists (please contact
