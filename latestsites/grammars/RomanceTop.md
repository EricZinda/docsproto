{% raw %}Delph-In currently includes implementation efforts for three Romance
languages: Spanish, [French](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/garage/GrenouilleSummary) (European standard
varieties) and [Portuguese](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/tools/DelphinLisbon). This part of the Wiki is
meant to be an active forum for discussion of common problems and
comparison of implemented/implementable solutions.

Contributions from non-Romance developers are also welcome and
appreciated!

- [Clitics](../RomClitics) in Romance, [Modern Greek](../MgrgSummary) (and
elsewhere)
- Uses of [SE](../RomSe)
- [P+Det contractions](../RomContract) Also very relevant to [Modern
Greek](../MgrgSummary).
