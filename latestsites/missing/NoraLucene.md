{% raw %}# Overview

# The current state of the Nora-Pipeline.

Everything is deployed to /logon/johanbev/wescience0. Everyone on the
ps.titan should have full access to this, this is also a potential
security breach. Please help fix this.

This setup uses Suns java 1.6, which is stored at my root at ps. The
needed jars are at /logon/johanbev/jars.

We have built a "Hello-World" app, extracting text from one pdf file and
indexing it with lucene. This app resideds at
/logon/johanbev/wescience0/Luctest. This hello world is used to help
check the environment at ps for our project. We have provided a helpful
run.sh which will invoke java with the right parameters to start the
app.
