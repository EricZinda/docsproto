{% raw %}At the [MPI for Evolutionary Anthropology Linguistics
Department](http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/) work on the
[Montage](http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/Montage/) project is being
carried out in collaboration with the [University of Washington
Computational Linguistics
Laboratory](http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/). The goal of Montage is
to develop a toolkit to assist field linguists in doing descriptive
analysis which makes use of techniques from grammar engineering to
assist them in searching, collating, and analyzing their data. The
project intends to build on several Delph-In technologies including the
[LKB](http://www.delph-in.net/lkb/), [\[incr
tsdb()](http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb/)\], and the [Grammar
Matrix](http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/). The main person working on
Montage at MPI EVA is [Jeff Good](http://email.eva.mpg.de/~good)
