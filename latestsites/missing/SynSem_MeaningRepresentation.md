{% raw %}# Background

The [SynSem research
group](https://cas.oslo.no/research-groups/synsem-from-form-to-meaning-integrating-linguistics-and-computing-article1805-827.html)
at the Oslo Center for Advanced Study (CAS) holds a working meeting on
design decisions in broad-coverage meaning representation and inference.
The meeting will be held from Monday, May 28, to Wednesday, May 30,
2018, at [Quality Hotel
Leangkollen](https://www.nordicchoicehotels.no/hotell/norge/asker/quality-hotel-leangkollen/?utm_source=googlemybusiness&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=regular-pictures)
just outside Oslo. Please note that the hotel web site is available in
English, including instructions on how to get there from the airport;
look towards the bottom of the page for the *language* selection. We
expect to start the programme on Monday morning after breakfast, i.e.
encourage everyone to travel to Oslo on Sunday already; on Wednesday, we
will wrap up the meeting over lunch time (no later than 13:30), so that
for most people it should be possible to still catch flights back home
that day.

# Logistics

Participants are expected to make their own travel arrangements to Oslo
and submit transportation receipts for reimbursement upon completion of
the meeting. SynSem has earmarked up to EUR 1200 per
participant traveling from outside Europe and up to EUR 400 per
participant from within Europe; in case you find it impossible to make
travel arrangements to Oslo within these limits, please make contact
with Dag and Stephan as soon as possible. Accomodation and meals while
in Oslo will be covered by SynSem directly.

Our meeting room is called *Steilene*, on one of the lower (cooler)
floors of the newer, ‘grey’ building.

Please submit your receipts for travel (airfare and airport transfers)
for [reimbursement
on-line](https://cas.oslo.no/expense-reimbursement-for-guests/) no later
than mid-June. After Friday, June 15, 2018, it will be impossible to
process reimbursement requests.

# Programme

We expect to prepare the programme collectively, with presentation (or
maybe demonstration) and discussion slots as obvious building blocks.
All participants are invited to (though not required) to present on
their ongoing work, possibly in collaborating teams. In a first
instance, we welcome suggestions for programme elements (of any type,
not limited to the above examples), which we will collect incrementally.

# High-Level Questions

Some of the central questions we want to engage with are, across
different traditions and frameworks

- What properties should meaning representations have in order to
facilitate inference?
- What kind of information should lexical resources encode to
facilitate inference?
- What kinds of inferential relations are essential for textual
inference?
- How is ambiguity and underspecification factored in, e.g. of scope,
word senses, anaphora?
- Can we have ‘robust inference’? Does the notion even make sense?

# Examples of Textual Inference Patterns

A selection of different types of ‘basic’ patterns from the so-called
[SICK dataset](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/composes/sick.html) (used for
Task 1 at [SemEval](/SemEval) 2014), by Jan, Martha, and Stephan:

- \[T\] A woman is slicing an onion.
- \[H\] An onion is being sliced by a woman. \[entailment\]
- \[T\] A woman is slicing an eggplant.
- \[H\] A woman is slicing a vegetable. \[entailment\]
- \[T\] There is no woman slicing an onion.
- \[H\] A woman is slicing an onion. \[contradiction\]
- \[T\] The woman is dicing a carrot.
- \[H\] A woman is slicing an onion. \[neutral\]
- \[T\] A bride in a white dress is running.
- \[H\] A girl in a white dress is running. \[entailment\]
- \[T\] People are looking at some costumes gathered in the vicinity
of the forest.
- \[H\] People wearing costumes are gathering in a forest and are
looking in the same direction. \[neutral\]
- \[T\] A group of scouts are hiking through the grass.
- \[H\] Some people are walking. \[entailment\]
- \[T\] The brown horse is near a red barrel at the rodeo.
- \[H\] The brown horse is far from a red barrel at the rodeo.
\[contradiction\]
- \[T\] A man who is playing is running with the ball in his hands.
- \[H\] A player is running with the ball. \[entailment\]
- The guitar is being played by the man.
- The man is a guitar player. \[entailment\]
- A man, a woman and two girls are walking on the beach.
- Four people are walking on the beach. \[entailment\]
- A man, a woman and two girls are walking on the beach.
- A group of people is on a beach. \[entailment\]

Some arguably more challenging instances, collected by Cleo Condoravdi
(the first from RTE):

- \[T\] Romano Prodi will meet the US President George Bush in his
capacity as the president of the European commission.
- \[H\] George Bush is the president of the European commission.

\[NYT of April 1, 2005\]

- \[T\] ABC News revealed today that Ted Koppel, the host of Nightline
for 25 years, would leave the network before his contract expired in
December.
- \[H\] Ted Koppel left ABC before December 2005.
- \[T\] ABC News revealed today that Ted Koppel, the host of Nightline
for 25 years, left the network before his contract expired in
December.
- \[H\] Ted Koppel left ABC before December 2004.
