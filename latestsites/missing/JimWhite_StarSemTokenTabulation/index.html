        <p>Count of tokens that don’t match either [letter|hyphen]+ or digit+.</p>

<p>The main issue is that single quote is not handled at all consistently.
Words that have either a contraction or possessive-s appear in some
cases as a single token and in others as two tokens.</p>

<p>Other problems include a quotation mark being stuck to the word
initially. Also a few other punctuation oddities like “hotel.-“ and
“year’66”.</p>
