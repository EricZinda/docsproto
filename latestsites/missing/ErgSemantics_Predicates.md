{% raw %}# Quantifiers

Possibly more distinctions in current grammar than we would need to
expose (e.g. def\_explicit\_q vs. def\_implicit\_q)?

# Conjunctions

Maybe introduce additional abstractions, e.g. ‘conjunctive’ vs.
‘disjunctive’ conjunctions. If so, implicit\_conj might need to be
sub-divided along that line.

# Intersective Modifiers

E.g. compound, unspec\_loc, etc. ... somehow, all the way down to the
prepositions, e.g. directional vs. stative readings of *She jumped in
the water.*

# Modal Operators
