{% raw %}The "Norwegian HPSG Resource Grammar" - [NorSource](/NorSource) - was
started in 2002, using the LKB platform and version 0.1 of the HPSG
Grammar Matrix. Its development was strongly furthered by the NTNU
participation in the [DeepThought](/DeepThought) project, in the course
of which the grammar reached a medium size coverage, and could import a
large lexicon. With domain specific enrichments pertaining to the
semantics of locative and directional expressions, the grammar was used
in a small end-to-end demo called "[TrailFinder](/TrailFinder)",
extracting mountain hike information from tour descriptions (to appear
in Proceedings of CLIN 2004). In the setting of a reasonably broad
coverage of phenomena, exploration of how to encode various types of
semantic specification remains a main focus.
