# Logistics

Participants are expected to make their own travel arrangements to Oslo
and submit transportation receipts for reimbursement upon completion of
the meeting. [SynSem](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/summits/SynSem) has earmarked up to EUR 1000 per
participant traveling from outside Europe and up to EUR 400 per
participant from within Europe; in case you find it impossible to make
travel arrangements to Oslo within these limits, please make contact
with Dag and Stephan as soon as possible. Accomodation and meals while
in Oslo will be covered by [SynSem](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/summits/SynSem) directly.

# Programme

We expect to prepare the programme collectively, with presentation (or
maybe demonstration) and discussion slots as obvious building blocks.
All participants are invited to (though not required) to present on
their ongoing work, possibly in collaborating teams (e.g. Dag and
Matthew on glue semantics for UD). In a first instance, we welcome
suggestions for programme elements (of any type, not limited to the
above examples), which we will collect incrementally.
