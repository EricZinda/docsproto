{% raw %}# Background

On Wednesday and Thursday, June 8 and 9, 2016, LTG staff will convene at
[Oscarsborg Hotell](http://www.oscarsborghotel.no/) for an off-site
retreat. The plan is to leave Oslo at 9:30 in the morning of June 8, so
that we can take a ferry from Drøbak onto the island leaving at 10:45
(just now the web site for the ferry service appears down, but the hotel
assures me the ferry runs). We will have four cars, with Emanuele, Jan
Tore, Pierre, and Stephan as drivers. There should be a pay-for-use
parking lot near the ferry terminal, and each driver should pay their
transfer-related expenses and submit for reimbursement after the
retreat. On June 9, we will finish (possibly with waffles) in the
afternoon and plan to leave the island no later than 16:00.

# Participants

To finalize our booking at the hotel, we need to provide a participant
list. I have made informed guesses about participation and dietary
preferences, but please double-check and either correct or let me know
by Friday, May 20.

# Programme

As at previous occasions, we will seek to combine scholarly and social
aspects in setting up our meeting programme. As regards the former, all
group members are invited to prepare an informal, high-level reflection
on their current and anticipated academic interests, and on the larger
group or even our field. We will discuss how to best make use of our
time on the island jointly at our next group meeting, on June 2.
Regarding the social programme, this aspect too is a shared opportunity
(or responsibility, some might say :-).
