{% raw %}The Natural Language and Information Processing
([NLIP](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/NL/index.html)) group within
[Cambridge University Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk)
conducts research over a wide spectrum of NLP topics. More about the
group as a whole can be found on the web pages.

Our Delphin related activities involve the development of the LKB system
(LkbTop) and of the MRS/RMRS approach to underspecified
compositional semantics for the Matrix grammars and for shallower
analysers (RmrsTop). Currently, we are most actively working
on tokenisation and morphology (funded by Boeing) and on the development
of RMRS and the SEM-I. A new project
([Sciborg](http://www.sciborg.org.uk)) which is extending work on
integration of deep and shallow processing started in October 2005.
