This page describes the Zhen MT system, an MT system based on the [LOGON
architecture](), using [MCG](http://mcg.opendfki.de/) for the
source language analysis and the ERG for the target language
generation.

Zhen is the younger sibling of [Jaen](/MTJaen), the Japanese-English MT
system. It is being built as part of Fan Zhenzhen's PhD.

There are some note on how to set up an MT system with the DELPH-In
tools in the MT tutorial.

A list of things that need to be fixed in Zhen can be found here: [Todo
list for Zhen](/MTZhenTodo)
