{% raw %}# Reverse Idiot, as played by DELPH-INites

This game is also known as "Contact" and played with slight variations.
Below is the variation as played in DELPH-IN circles.

## High-level overview

- Players: 3+, but 5-10 seems optimal
- Teams: "It" v. rest of the players
- Starting: It thinks of a word ("target word") and divulges the first
letter. Generally whoever comes up with a word first is It.
- Game play:
  - Other players work together to get It to divulge their word,
letter by letter until someone guesses the full word.
  - This is done by providing clues to other words ("candidate
words") consistent with the known target word prefix.
  - There is no turn rotation: Players provide clues as they think
of them.
  - It can defend against such clues by saying "No it's not X" where
X is a word that is consistent with both the clue and the known
prefix.
    - If X is not in fact the candidate word, but players agree it
is consistent with the clue, then for the clue to remain
live the clue giver has to refine it.
  - Other players, if they think they know the candidate word
matching the clue, raise 10 fingers and count down, giving It 10
more seconds to defend the clue.
  - If It fails to in that time, then the player who has finished
counting says their guess as to the candidate word.
  - The clue giver confirms whether or not it matches what they had
in mind.
    - If so, then It has to divulge one more letter.
    - If not, then the clue is still live (but can be abandoned).
- A round ends when all the letters are divulged or (more commonly) a
player proposes a candidate word that matches the target word.
Either the player who proposed the clue or the player who guesses
the candidate word is the next It.

## Examples

It: My word starts with *m*.

A: Is it supernatural?

It: Not it is not *magic*.

B: Is it useful for measuring?

It: Not it is not the *metric system*.

B \[refining their clue\]: Is it useful for measuring temperature?

C: Got it! \[Holds up hands and starts counting down from 10\]

C \[Having gotten to 0\]: *Mercury*?

B: Yes, that was my word!

It: The next letter is *a*.

C: Is it a bland condiment?

It: It might be...

A: Got it! \[After counting down\] *Mayonnaise*.

It: Yep, that's it. \[At this point, C or A is the next It.\]

## Side cases, further notes

- Both the target and candidate words must be English words (including
well established borrowings) and may not be only proper nouns.
However, words that are homophonous with proper nouns can be evoked
via their proper noun sense.
- When desperate (i.e. when it becomes difficult to think of candidate
words given the known prefix) it is customary to come up with clues
of the form "Is it how Francis would spell..." but generally
additional letters are not earned via such clues.
- If someone ends up being It again before everyone has had a turn,
they can arrow someone else to do it in their stead.
