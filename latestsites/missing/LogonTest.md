{% raw %}# Overview

The LOGON Test Harness is an on-going effort at building a suite of
fully-automated test cases that verify various aspects of LOGON
functionality. The harness is built from the core LOGON components,
[\[incr tsdb()\]](http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb) functionality, and
Un\*x-style shell scripts.

A spin-off activity to the test harness is the LOGON
/BenchmarkingSuite.
