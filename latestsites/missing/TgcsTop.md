{% raw %}# TGCS: TDL Grammar Composition System

A project to develop a system for processing DELPH-IN style TDL grammars
within the .NET and Mono runtime environments.

## Abstract

### A new TDL parser and unification engine for the CLI

The Common Language Infrastructure (CLI, ECMA-335) is a modern standard
for architecting extensible, platform-independent software. Well-known
implementations include Mono and Microsoft's .NET Framework. These
relatively new environments enjoy the robust support of actively
developed software, and incorporate decades of research and best
practice experience in systems architecture and developer productivity.
An aim of this project is to explore the suitability of this platform
for a new suite of tools for processing DELPH-IN style TDL grammars.

Single-core performance having reached physical limits, the focus in
high-performance computing now concerns multi-core processors.
Accordingly, another goal of this project is to examine opportunities
for concurrent programming in the processing of analytical grammars.
This effort has led to the development of a low-lock, concurrent chart
parser which exploits new deep operating system support for scalable,
fine-grained concurrency.

## Project Status

As of November 2010, the system loads the Thai matrix grammar and
produces all correct parses for the 205 sentences in the testsuite. A
next step is to implement *irules* and *lrules* support--which is not
required by the Thai grammar--in anticpation of being able to run the
ERG.

Work has been divided into a few components, which currently demonstrate
the following features:

### Type System

- Robustly read, validate, and tokenize TDL grammars, providing
precise indication of syntax errors;
- Build the type system and efficiently calculate the greatest lower
bound closure via a method that improves modestly on the Ait-Kaci
technique;
- Load feature structures into an internal representation that is
hoped to support efficient TFS unification (see below)

### Unification Engine

- Unify types with their constraints, properly handling coreferences
- Fully expand the authored types/constraints
- Low-lock concurrency at the single-unification level

### Concurrency Chart Parser

- Capitalizing on new OS support for lightweight tasks scheduled with
sophisticated hill-climbing, work-stealing, and load-balancing, a
new, non-blocking unification chart parser works by constructing a
graph of fully asynchronous fine-grained match/unify tasks.
- "Hyper-active" deferral (Oepen and Carroll, 2000) of active edge
realization
- Rule pre-filter (Kiefer et al. 1999)
- Additionally, the following grammar-opt-in techniques developed in
the DELPH-IN community and elsewhere: KEY-daughter first,
Quick-check (Malouf et al. 2000), and daughter ARGS pruning.
- Direct daughter unify with skeleton completion: parts of the rule
mother TFS which are outside of her rule daughter's coreference
extent are only built upon successful daughter unification.
- Literature review for ambiguity packing is in progress

### Application Notes

- Centralize grammar engineering tasks in a single software
environment
- To facilitate MT engineering, the engine supports working with
multiple loaded grammars (see image below)
- Platform independent command processing will enable a Mono-based
interactive client
- Built-in support for the standard \[incr tsdb()\] testsuite database
format
- As with most CLR software, the same executable binary should run on
any combination of 32 or 64-bit Mono or .NET

### WPF Client Application

- Display and interact with feature structures in a style inspired by
LUI
- Note: WPF support will not be available on Mono

## TFS Representation

One research goal is to investigate the efficiency--under the intensive
demands that are characteristic of unification grammars--of a diffuse
***feature-centric TFS representation***. Informed by Pereira (1985),
Wroblewski (1987), Tomabechi (1991), and recent work by van Lohuizen,
this project tests an internal representation of DAGs which may minimize
GC activity during parsing. While research attention since Pereira
(1985) has focused on reducing the *number* of DAG copy operations, this
work seeks to reduce the cost of the copy operation *itself*.
Capitalizing on the observations that, in DELPH-IN grammars:

- the type hierarchy is fixed, and
- a feature can only be introduced at one place in the type hierarchy,

this approach stores every edge in a hash list associated with its
introducing feature, so a particular TFS instance actually has no
centralized node manifestation. There is exactly one list for each
feature, and this list freely mixes edges from any TFS for which the
feature is appropriate. Since these lists only expand their capacity
periodically, and typically do not contract when edges are abandoned for
later reuse, it is hoped that operating system allocation penalties will
be greatly reduced.

Initial work with this model--belabored by extreme care in the
considered application of C\# value types--has shown great promise for
adequate performance in linguistic applications.
