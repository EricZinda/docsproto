{% raw %}# DELPH-IN Developers Meeting

This page contains some information about the DELPH-IN developers
meeting to be held at CSLI in 2007-03. We are trying a shorter meeting
where people can talk about what they are doing and what they want to
do, in an attempt to coordinate our efforts. Many potential participants
are likely to be at CSLI a bit before/after the meeting, so individual
issues can be worked on then.

Mar 1--2, 2007

Place\
CSLI, Stanford University

Participants\
EmilyBender, FrancisBond,
AnnCopestake, DanFlickinger,
StephanOepen, UlrichSchaefer,
