{% raw %}# Picnic\* on the Seine

**When**: Tuesday, June 19, 7:30 pm - 10 pm (or stay however late you
like...)

**Where**: Right bank of the Seine river, roughly across Musee D'Orsay
(but we'll see what the best spot is)

**Meeting**: Metro Pont Neuf (line 7) 7:30 pm, waiting a few minutes,
then go down to the river bank and walk West to find a good spot
(preferably with the Eiffel tower view; note that the Eifell tower
lights up at 10 pm, 11 pm, etc). Olga will email the list the exact
location once we set up.

**Who**: If you plan to join, please sign up and indicate what you will
bring (e.g.: cheese, bread, wine).

\* While for many people picnic means a blanket, *true* Parisians just
sit on the stone :).
