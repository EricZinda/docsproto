# Recommended Courses

For all students on ‘our’ programme (Informatics: Language and
Communication), the following courses are obligatory: INF4820, INF5820,
and INF5830; all run in the fall, with INF5820 and INF5830 alternating
from year to year. For students following the ‘standard’ progression,
this means that they need to select one additional course in their first
(fall) semester, and another two in their second (spring) semester.
Typically, students pick courses for their first semester without
consultation with candidate supervisors, but during this semester (while
selecting an area of specialization and supervisor(s)) they should
decide on remaining course work for their degree \_in agreement\_ with
their supervisor(s).

For students who have not taken INF4800 before (e.g. as INF3800 in their
BSc studies), this seems like a plausible recommendation. Furthermore,
we have at times suggested the following courses at our own department:

- INF4580: Semantic Technologies
- INF3490: Biologically-Inspired Computing
- [SPR4106: Syntax and Semantics in Formal
Terms](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/ilos/SPR4106/)
- [INF4350: Introductory Course in
Bioinformatics](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF4350/index-eng.html)
- [INF4380: Introduction to
Robotics](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF4380/index-eng.html)

# Mailing List Management

All active MSc students should be subscribed to the mailing list
[ltg-msc@ifi.uio.no](https://sympa.uio.no/ifi.uio.no/info/ltg-msc)
throughout the duration of their studies. It is the responsibility of
the supervisor(s) to add student emails (preferably using their official
UiO address) to the mailing list, and to unsubscribe students when they
complete their degree or otherwise are no longer supervised at the
group.

As students enter their second MSc semester, i.e. once they start work
on their scientific essay (see below), they are more than welcome to
participate in the LTG research seminar. Even though there will always
be some presentations (or maybe even most, in some semesters) that will
be difficult for MSc students to relate to in full depth, the exposure
to research presentations by itself will often have a beneficial,
‘horizon-widening’ effect. The supervisor(s) gauge the expected benefits
of seminar participation and encourage students to engage as they fit.

# Scientific Essay

# Thesis Submission

# Thesis Review

Before the thesis is submitted, the supervisor(s) suggest(s) a reviewing
commitee, comprised of one external and one internal reviewer. The
external must be from outside UiO and can be from outside Norway, but
preferably not outside Europe (or more specifically the ‘Bologna area’).
Ideally, the external reviewer should have some experience in MSc-level
thesis (supervision and) reviewing. The internal reviewer should
typically be chosen from the faculty members of our group (Erik, Jan
Tore, Lilja, Stephan). Neither reviewer needs to be specialized in the
exact topic area of the MSc thesis, but both they should be able to
judge the work, scholarly, technically, and practically; it may make
sense to have the external and internal reviewers complement each other.
Prior to the proposal, the supervisor(s) should seeks to confirm that
the reviewers are willing to participate in the committee.

The director of the I:SK Programme Board (currently Jan Tore) approves
the proposed commitee; the group manager (currently Stephan) coordinates
the allocation of internal reviewers among group members (aiming to
load-balance over time). Once approved, the supervisor emails the
committee details to the study adminstration.

From there on, the study administration is responsible to send an
appointment letter and the thesis to the external reviewer; however, the
supervisor should make sure that both the external and internal
reviewers receive the thesis as quickly as possible. Often, it may be
good to send an electronic advance copy, for example. Additionally, the
supervisor(s) should make sure that the committee is aware of the ‘new’
faculty-wide procedures for grade usage:

Well in advance of the period allocated for oral presentations, the
supervisor schedules the time for the presentation in agreement with the
reviewers, supervisor(s), and maybe even the candidate. A common
procedure is to allow one hour for committee-internal discussion of the
thesis, about one hour for the presentation by the candidate and
discussion, and at least another half hour for final committee
deliberation and paperwork.

The internal reviewer acts as the secretary of the committee, i.e. fills
in the official ‘exam’ report) that the study administration provides
(typically via the supervisor). The supervisor sees to it that these
reports are signed and returned to the study administration in a timely
manner.

The standard schedule for reviews is as follows:

- the reviewing committee meets for one hour, to discuss the strengths
and weaknesses of the thesis and set a grade; the supervisor(s)
participate in this meeting initially, to provide background
information on the genesis of the thesis, but then leaves the room
to let the reviewers discuss among themselves;
- the candidate, supervisor(s), and public audience join the reviewing
committee; the candidate provides an oral summary of the main
research results in the thesis of between 30 and 45 minutes;
afterwards, the reviewers engage the candidate in a scientific
discussion of the research, typically for around at least another
half hour;
- upon completion of the presentation and discusssion, the reviewing
committee deliberates in private on the grade for the oral
presentation and then inform the candidate, including brief oral
feedback on the thesis and presentation.
