{% raw %}Notes from the open space group on "big questions", which ended up being
on interfaces and how to get the right part of the grammar to do the
right thing and how one might construct a database of key examples in
syntax (and semantics).

We decided that constructing such a database would be very time
consuming and without assurances of uptake by the relevant communities,
probably not a good investment of time.

Instead, we thought it would be useful to collect links to existing
resources somewhat in that space, either listing examples or
descriptions of phenomena:
