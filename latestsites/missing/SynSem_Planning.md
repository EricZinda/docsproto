# Background

This page collects logistical and contentful information on the first
all-hands SynSem meeting, from Monday, February 6, to
Wednesday, February 8. The meeting will be hosted at [Lysebu
Hotel](http://www.lysebu.no/en/), just outside of Oslo.

To help calibrate expectations, we have posted a copy of the original
[project proposal](http://www.delph-in.net/synsem/proposal.pdf) (which
is now two years out of date) and [some
impressions](http://moin.delph-in.net/SynSem/Impressions) from at and
near the Oslo Center for Advanced Research.

The programme will start at 10:00 in the morning of February 6 in
meeting room *Fyn*. There will be a social dinner (starting at 19:30)
for those arriving early enough on Sunday evening.

# Transportation

The hotel is accessible by [public
transport](https://ruter.no/en/journey-planner/Mellom/Fra/%281000027633%29Oslo%20airport%20%28omr%C3%A5de%29%20%28Ullensaker%29/til/%283012390%29Voksenkollen%20%5BT-bane%5D%20%28Oslo%29/etter/050220171300/#st:0,sp:0,bp:0),
where the final leg requires a ten-minute walk along a minor road. The
hotel is close to the stop called *Voksenkollen* on the *T-bane*
(‘tunnel train’, running underground in the city center and above ground
otherwise). From downtown Oslo, take the T-bane line \#1 towards
*Frognerseteren*. When coming from the airport, one can either transfer
at the main train station (*Oslo S*) or at *Nationaltheatret*; transit
onto the T-bane is slightly easier and faster at the latter station, but
some trains coming from the airport only go to *Oslo S*.

From the airport, take the airport express train (*Flytoget*) to either
*Oslo S* (all trains) or *Nationaltheatret* (every other train). There
are other options—regional and local trains—too, but these are less
frequent and operate on a different ticket system than *Flytoget*. As
you leave the customs area, turn right and walk straight towards the
*Flytoget* departure terminal. Tickets are available from vending
machines (using all sorts of credit cards) and possibly a staffed ticket
office; there is no benefit in getting a round-trip ticket.

At *Oslo S* or (preferably) *Nationaltheatret* follow the ‘T’ signs to
transfer into the T-bane and find the platform for line \#1 in the
direction of *Frognerseteren*. You will need a separate ticket for the
T-bane, which in turn will be available from vending machines; seeing as
you will be returning to Oslo soon, consider pre-installing the [mobile
ticket
application](https://ruter.no/en/buying-tickets/mobile-ticket-app/),
which will make public transport a lot easier (but does not cover the
*Flytoget* line, which provides its own mobile application, if you are
determined). The T-bane will gradually take you up the hills surrounding
Oslo, past the
*[Holmenkollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmenkollen)* ski jump,
and eventually to the *Voksenkollen* stop, which is near the end of the
line.

At the *Voksenkollen* stop you leave the platform in the direction
‘against’ the incoming T-bane line, i.e. turn right as you leave the
train, and slightly right again onto the countryside road that runs past
the T-bane stop. There are signs towards *Lysebu hotell* at the road,
and after walking around a gentle curve and past the *Lysebu* bus stop,
one turns right onto an even smaller, dead-end road towards the hotel.
In case you want to look for on-line assistance, the address of the
hotel is *[Lysebuveien 12, 0790
Oslo](https://www.google.no/maps/place/Lysebuveien+12,+0790+Oslo/@59.9784574,10.6575152,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4641729aba77cc3d:0xe21c2196e2d0294!8m2!3d59.9772362!4d10.6555089?hl=en)*.

*[Voksenkollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voksenkollen_%28station%29)*
is situated many hundred meters above Oslo and well beyond the bounds of
civilization; please prepare adequately for your trip and observe the
[mountain code](https://english.dnt.no/the-norwegian-mountain-code/). In
case of an emergency (or other needs for assistance), please call
Stephan at +47 4546 6632.

# Schedule

There will be five basic types of programme elements: (a) plenary
discussion of ‘grand’ research questions; (b) an [open
space](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/OpenSpaces.html)
experiment; (c) two parallel reading groups; (d) contrastive
syntactico-semantic analysis of nominated sentences; and (e) social and
‘downtime’ activities. While we suggest an outline below, we expect that
the group will be free to collaboratively adjust and re-prioritize as we
see fit.
