### With Or Without (Udef\_)Q

    Leave the scope underspecified
    Let the ARG resolve to i
    I scope for you
    
    Labeled rels and all of that
    In a bag of preds are nice and flat
    And I scope without you
    
    With or without q
    With or without q
    
    Through hcons we lost qstore
    Is one scope all? No I find more
    And I'm scoping for you
    
    With or without q
    With or without q
    I can't scope
    With or without q
    
    It's ambiguous that way
    It's ambiguous that way
    Q-E-Q
    Q-E-Q
    It's ambiguous that way
    
    My x unbound
    My labels loose; you've got me with
    No way to scope and
    Nothing left to prove
    
    It's ambiguous that way
    It's ambiguous that way
    Q-E-Q
    Q-E-Q
    It's ambiguous that way
    
    With or without q
    With or without q
    I can't scope
    With or without q
    
    With or without q
    With or without q
    I can't scope
    With or without q
    With or without q
