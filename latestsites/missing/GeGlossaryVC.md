## VC \[feature: VerbCluster \]

The feature VC stands for 'Verb Cluster', and keeps track whether the
main-verb is present in cluster ( +) or not ( -). The value of VC is
luk, allowing for a third possibility of na, for not applicable. It is
introduced in **lex-or-phrase-synsem**. ('matrix.tdl', HPSG Grammar
