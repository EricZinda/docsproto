{% raw %}This page provides a top level view of information about treebanking in
the DELPH-IN wiki.

If you have any guides not included here, please add them.

There are some language specific guides:

- [ErgTreebanking](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/erg/ErgTreebanking)
- [IndraTreebanking](../IndraTreebanking)

This is probably the closest thing we currently have to a general guide.

- [ErgTreebankingGuidelines](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/erg/ErgTreebankingGuidelines) although still
very language specific

And some guides to tools:

- [Modern Treebanking with the Full Forest Treebanker](../FftbTop)
  
  - [Lexical Type Database](https://github.com/fcbond/ltdb)
descriptions of rules, lexical types and more can be found here
- [Classic Treebanking with the Fine System](../ItsdbTreebanking)
