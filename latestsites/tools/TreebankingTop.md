{% raw %}This page provides a top level view of information about treebanking in
the DELPH-IN wiki.

If you have any guides not included here, please add them.

There are some language specific guides:

- ErgTreebanking
- IndraTreebanking

This is probably the closest thing we currently have to a general guide.

- ErgTreebankingGuidelines although still
very language specific

And some guides to tools:

- Modern Treebanking with the Full Forest Treebanker
  
  - [Lexical Type Database](https://github.com/fcbond/ltdb)
descriptions of rules, lexical types and more can be found here
- Classic Treebanking with the Fine System
