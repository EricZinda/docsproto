{% raw %}# Background

At the [2013 DELPH-IN Summit](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/summits/SaarlandTop), the first day was opened by
a short ‘tutorial’ of key DELPH-IN ingredients—aiming to give a
high-level picture of the DELPH-IN ecosystem and introduce relevant
jargon for novices. The 2013 tutorial was presented by
[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender) and [StephanOepen](../StephanOepen). Following
is an über-summary of the material presented (including that which we
didn't have time for, as well as further addenda after the fact):

- [Processing](../DelphinTutorial_Processing)
- [Grammars](../DelphinTutorial_Grammars)
- [Formalisms](../DelphinTutorial_Formalisms)
- [Distributions](../DelphinTutorial_Distributions)

Please give feedback (e.g. on remaining open questions, inaccuracies, or
omissions) to Emily and Stephan.

Another source of terms and definitions is the (more than mildly
out-of-date) [DelphinGlossary](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/summits/DelphinGlossary).
