{% raw %}# Immediate Challenges

Notes from [FeforGrammarians](../FeforGrammarians) sessin on immediate
challenges to grammar development.

- [FeforIndexAccess](../FeforIndexAccess) - Linguistic phenomena seeming
to require access to indices of saturated arguments (beyond XARG).
- [FeforDeepGrammarRmrsification](../FeforDeepGrammarRmrsification) -
Linguistic phenomena for which we cannot give well-formed MRSs
compositionally, but can with RMRS (or some intermediate step).
