{% raw %}# Immediate Challenges

Notes from FeforGrammarians sessin on immediate
challenges to grammar development.

- FeforIndexAccess - Linguistic phenomena seeming

- FeforDeepGrammarRmrsification -
Linguistic phenomena for which we cannot give well-formed MRSs
compositionally, but can with RMRS (or some intermediate step).
