{% raw %}# DELPH-IN at the NTT Communication Science Laboratories

The [NTT Communication Science
Laboratories](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/), in particular the [Machine
Translation Research Group](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/mtg) is
working with DELPH-IN as part of our research into natural language
understanding.

We are currently building the Hinoki treebank, a sense-tagged treebanked
corpus of dictionary definition and example sentences. From this we then
automatically induce an ontology. We use and extend the [JACY Japanese
grammar](http://www.delph-in.net/jacy), cooperating with, among others,
the DFKI, NAIST, Kyoto University and CSLI. We also play a part in
testing, documenting and enhancing the
[LKB](http://www.delph-in.net/lkb), [PET](http://www.delph-in.net/pet),
the [\[incr tsdb()\]](http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb) profiler
([ItsdbTop](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/tools/ItsdbTop)), the [ERG](http://www.delph-in.net/erg) and other
components.
