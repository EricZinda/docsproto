PyDelphin is a Python library for working with DELPH-IN representations,
as well as client interfaces to the [ACE](../AceTop) processor and [web
API](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/erg/ErgApi).

PyDelphin can be installed from the [Python Package
index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) as follows:

    $ pip3 install pydelphin

But it is recommended to install in a virtual environment for your
application. For example:

```
   1 $ python3 -m venv env      # create a virtual environment
   2 $ source env/bin/activate  # activate the environment
   3 $ pip install pydelphin    # install to the environment
   4 
```
