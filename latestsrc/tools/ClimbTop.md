## How to start a CLIMB grammar

There are several ways to start a CLIMB grammar.

1\. Download the [Grammar Matrix customization
system](http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/) and extend it to cover the
phenomena you would like to add to your grammar

2\. Obtain gCLIMB and adapt and extend it

3\. Obtain SlaviCLIMB and adapt and extend it

If your language is similar to German, 2. is the way to go.

If your language is a Slavic language or shares properties with Slavic
languages, it best to start from SlaviCLIMB.

## Declarative CLIMB

## Path Abbreviation

Feature Geometry extraction, the path abbreviation and completion
algorithms are included in gCLIMB.
