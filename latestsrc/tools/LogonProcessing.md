{% raw %}# Overview

This page documents facilities available for batch processing in LOGON;
please see the [LogonTop](../LogonTop) page for general background.

Many of the common batch processing tasks can be run from the command
line using the LOGON tree, typically invoked through a shell script in
the top-level LOGON directory (the path corresponding to the shell
variable $LOGONROOT). The scripts often support multiple grammars or
system configurations, and these can be parameterized by means of
command line arguments.
