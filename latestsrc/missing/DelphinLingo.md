{% raw %}The LinGO (Linguistic Grammars Online) Laboratory at the Center for the
Study of Language and Information ([CSLI](http://www-csli.stanford.edu))
is committed to the development of linguistically precise grammars based
on the HPSG framework, and general-purpose tools for use in grammar
engineering, profiling, parsing and generation. Early work in the LinGO
Lab focused on the construction of a general-purpose grammar of English
in the form of the English Resource Grammar (or
[ERG](http://www.delph-in.net/erg/)), and on further development of the
LKB ([LkbTop](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/tools/LkbTop)) grammar engineering system. The LKB was also used
at CSLI as the testbed for a number of teaching grammars and
smaller-scale grammars for other languages including Japanese and
Spanish. Early development of the ERG was carried out as part of the
[Verbmobil](http://verbmobil.dfki.de/overview-us.html) machine
translation project, as well as in a National Science Foundation project
on computer-aided speech generation for people who cannot speak because
of disability. The LinGO Laboratory also gave rise to the development of
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS), a semantic representation language
employed in many [Delph-in](http://www.delph-in.net) systems.

The ERG has been used in research on multiword expressions (MWEs)
jointly funded by the NSF and NTT Communication Science Laboratories,
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, and the ERG was also
extended for use in hybrid information extraction as part of the [Deep
Thought](http://www.project-deepthought.net) project. It is currently
being used and further developed in a project funded by NTT to extract
ontological information from dictionaries, by parsing dictionary
definitions to produce MRS representations as the basis for extraction
rules. The ERG is also being deployed in the construction of a novel,
rich and dynamic treebank for HPSG, the LinGO Redwoods
([RedwoodsTop](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/garage/RedwoodsTop)) initiative. It is also being used for
generation (realization) within the [LOGON](http://www.emmtee.net)
Norwegian-English machine translation project.

We are separately bringing together our grammar writing experience
across a variety of languages in devising a [Grammar
Matrix](http://www.delph-in.net/matrix) to aid in the development of
broad-coverage, precision, implemented grammars for natural languages.
