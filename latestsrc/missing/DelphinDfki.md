[DFKI Language Technology Lab](http://www.dfki.de/lt) is a research team
directed by [Hans Uszkoreit](http://www.dfki.de/~hansu) at
[DFKI](http://www.dfki.de) (German Research Center for Artificial

DFKI LT is working on various topics in language technology, including
HPSG Grammar development for German and
[Japanese](http://www.delph-in.net/jacy).

Software contributions to [Delph-In](http://www.delph-in.net) include
the further development and extensions to
[PET](http://www.delph-in.net/pet) and the [Heart of
Gold](http://www.delph-in.net/heartofgold) middleware for the
integration of deep and shallow natural language processing components
including adapters to various components such as
[PET](http://www.delph-in.net/pet),
[TnT](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~thorsten/tnt/),
[ChaSen](http://chasen.aist-nara.ac.jp) and
[SProUT](http://sprout.dfki.de).

The grammars and technologies are and have been applied and extended in
various research projects such as
[WHITEBOARD](http://www.dfki.de/lt/redirect.cgi?whiteboard),
[DeepThought](http://www.project-deepthought.net), and
[QUETAL](http://quetal.dfki.de).
