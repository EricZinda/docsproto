{% raw %}The Centre for Language Technology, or CST, (www.cst.dk) at the
University of Copenhagen works with many areas of human language
technology, both at the European level and within Denmark. Our research
activities include formal grammatical descriptions of Danish (both LFG
and HPSG), lexicography, machine translation, evaluation of HLT
products, text proofing tools, language technology in multimodal systems
and content-based querying.

We have developed a medium-size Danish grammar in the LKB system, which
has been used for parsing of user queries and text fragments in the
Danish project Ontoquery (www.cst.dk/ontoquery) and the EU project MOSES
(www.cst.dk/moses). In both projects, we have used PET to run the
grammar.

In addition, a number of satellite grammars are developed in LKB and
related platforms. CST participated in the Scandinavian Network of
Machine Translation and Grammar Engineering, as a result of which a
small-coverage translation system was developed for Mainland
Scandinavian. Finally, a number of CST researchers are engaged in
empirical and formal studies of HPSG. Some of this work aims at defining
formally restrictive fragments of HPSG without loss of empirical
adequacy.
