{% raw %}# Overview

The 9th DELPH-IN summit will be held from Monday, July 29, to Friday
August 2, 2013, in or around Saabr√ºcken. The following week [ACL
2013](http://acl2013.org/site/) will be held in Sofia, following our
lead last year.

Yi, Rui and Hans wil be local hosts, with Francis and Emily as
co-chairs.

## Aims of the Meeting

The purposes of this meeting are to:

- update each other on recent developments and current activities;
- discuss more what we actually expect from DELPH-IN (and each other);
- create the opportunity for contentful exchange on computational grammar research in the DELPH-IN spirit.

## Some possible ideas for content

These ideas are basically just brainstorming at this stage, and should
not be considered official in any way at all.

- Maybe try a couple of documentation sprints (like minor [book sprints](http://www.booksprints.net/))
- something on chart mapping?
- something on language modelling?
- something on unspoken MRS conventions?
- Work towards releasing MRS Testsuite treebanks as a parallel treebank resource

Discussion topics:

- core.smi for Matrix/general crosslinguistic sharing? What can we normalize here?
- How has the SEM-I been used in the past? How might it be used in the future?

And more light-heartedly:

- DELPH-IN t-shirt design proposals (suggested slogan: "Slow and steady wins the race")

## Travel info

- By air/by rail to sb
- Hotel
