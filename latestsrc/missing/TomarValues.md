{% raw %}# Background

Ever since we re-launched the public [DELPH-IN web
pages](http://www.delph-in.net) (in 2014), several of us (in the
Standing Committee, and beyond) have felt we should try to produce a
*mission statement* for DELPH-IN, i.e. a comparatively short, concise
text that spells out the most important, high-level (defining, in a
sense) aspects of the collaboration. Part of the motivation here can be
to educate and motivate ourselves, another part can be ‘marketing’
value, i.e. utility in introducing the larger world to the DELPH-IN
philosophy.

# Candidate Values

DELPH-IN contributors are united by a shared set of values, beliefs, and
goals, viz.

- **linguistic precision**: DELPH-IN continues the tradition of
declarative (unification- or constraint-based) formal grammatical
analysis, applied to a diverse range of languages, with deep roots
in [Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar](http://hpsg.stanford.edu)
(HPSG).
- **syntax** and **semantics**: DELPH-IN studies syntactic structure
and the composition of sentence meaning jointly, supporting
underspecified logical-form semantic interface representations in
the framework of Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS).
- **open-source collaboration**: DELPH-IN develops and maintains a
shared, open-source repository of interoperable tools and grammars,
capitalizing on transparency of the development process, community
involvement, and re-use.
- **scalability** and **usability**: DELPH-IN targets ‘realistic’
language data, facilitating the processing of running text; its
resources are engineered to a degree that enables practical
applications, including commercial ones.
- **sustainability** and **interoperability**: Some DELPH-IN grammars
have been developed for more than two decades; its joint reference
formalism enables sustained, incremental development over time and
cross-component interoperability.

# Way Forward

- Discuss at 2014 Business Meeting;
- Prepare complete draft and circulate;
- Adopt through Standing Committee; or
- Hold general vote among participants?
