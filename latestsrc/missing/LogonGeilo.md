{% raw %}# Overview

The [LOGON](http://www.emmtee.net) consortium holds its final meeting
from June 6 through June 8, 2007, in [Geilo](http://www.geilo.no/),
Norway. Focussing on its Norwegian-English MT demonstrator, the
consortium will highlight scientific accomplishments, present and
discuss black- and glass-box evaluation results on held-out data,
reflect on strong and weak points of the approach, and discuss follow-up
activities. These pages will, over time, provide useful information to
participants, both organizational and content-wise. Please check
regularly for updates and additional information.

# Structure of the Meeting

The meeting will be broken into two parts, of which the first day
(Wednesday) is an internal meeting of contributors to the LOGON book.
For the second half of the meeting (Thursday and Friday), the project
has invited a number of former LOGON participants (including recipients
of MSc stipends), and a small number of external experts. Thursday will
focus on project results, including the presentation (and discussion) of
an in-depth output quality evaluation, by virtue of human judgments on
held-out data, which the consortium is currently gathering. The final
day of the meeting will be more workshop-like, jointly reflecting on
perspectives for further hybridization of MT approaches and our views on
the utility (if any) of \`deep' NLP paradigms in general. Guests will be
invited to contribute presentations on their own work and visions.

# Organizational

The meeting will be held at [Dr. Holms Hotel](http://www.drholms.no/) in
[Geilo](http://www.geilo.no/), Norway. Geilo is a mountain village in
Southern Norway and traditional winter resort. It is best reached in a
little over three hours by [train](http://www.nsb.no) from either Oslo
or Bergen. In Geilo, the hotel is within easy walking distance from the
train station (around 250 meters, according to Jan Tore). The hotel is
prepared to pick up participants from the station; please make prior
arrangements with the hotel directly, in case you require transfer
assistance in Geilo. For travel to and from Oslo airport, please see the
[EAMT 2006](http://eamt.emmtee.net) conference pages. The [airport
express train](http://www.flytoget.no) takes approximately twenty
minutes between Gardermoen (the airport) and Oslo S (the main train
station).

It will be possible to catch a train back to Bergen or Oslo right after
completion of the meeting on Friday; however, train connections on the
following day may afford greater flexibility for those traveling abroad.

For those having to stay overnight in Oslo prior to their departing
flight, the [Radisson
Gardemoen](http://www.radissonsas.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=RadissonSAS/integration/hotelInfo&hotelCode=oslzr)
hotel at the airport may be the most convenient. Using a little more
time to explore Oslo, the [Radisson
Plaza](http://www.radissonsas.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=RadissonSAS/integration/hotelInfo&hotelCode=oslzh)
or [Astoria](http://www.thonhotels.no/astoria) hotels are both very
close to the downtain train station.

Should people want to explore some more of Norway, the
[EAMT](http://eamt.emmtee.net/index.php?page=5#fun) pages have some
suggestions and pointers. Geilo is a good starting location for the
famed [Norway in a Nutshell](http://www.norwaynutshell.com/) tour.
