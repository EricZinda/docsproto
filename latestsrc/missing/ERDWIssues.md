{% raw %}# ERG Reference Documentation Working Group Open Issues

- What "documentation" work has already been done. Need to do a survey
  - Francis work with web interface to browse grammar
  - Annotations in the source
  - The Wiki
  - Existing papers 
  - etc.
- Where does the documentation live?
- What form are the docs written in?
- How do you search?
- Who can help write content?
- Are there two sets of some docs?
  - One set for folks who just need practical how to stuff (including Grad Students)?
  - One set for grammarians, Grad Students?
  - We will see how far we can get unifying these in our prototyping
- How does the community feel about erase existing wiki content? Feels destructive. Do we have a history that we can revert to? Or are we always writing new docs?
- I'm unclear about our comfort level with linking and citations from"the literature" and what is considered definitive, etc. Be good to establish this (for ericz at least). 
- We should discuss what canonical MRS form we want for all the docs
- Understand how to exploit the mechanism that francis and colleagues have built to to tie examples with example sentences better for grammarians
  - Having the doc strings in the grammar has worked well in principle but in practice we can't share the burden beyond Dan.  Is there a branch of the ERG where people can put in docs and it gets reviewed?
  - How large is the pool of people that can document the semantics of the ERG?
- Figure out how to do release notes with the grammar
  - Changes to grammar rule names: irritating but inevitable. Give some thought to the fact that underlying things will change.  Find a way to alert people that changes have happened.  
- How to getting visibility into the current plan for the ERG?
