{% raw %}# Background

Between 2004 (or so) and 2022, the DELPH-IN consortium operated a range of subscription-based email lists for internal communication.
As communication patterns have evolved, and with increasing challenges in keeping a self-hosted email solution free of spam, the DELPH-IN Standing Committee in mid-2022 made official what has been the actual state of affairs for a little while, to deactive all email lists and focus on communication and collaboration on M$ GitHub and the UW-hosted Discourse forum instead.
The original email communication remains available for archival purposes.
