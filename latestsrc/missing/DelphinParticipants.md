{% raw %}# Overview

This page is intended as an up-to-date summary of research groups and
individuals associated to the DELPH-IN open-source repository. While
preparing for a first general meeting (at Lisboa, in August 2005), we
hope to encourage all participants to provide a brief, high-level
summary of their own R&D activities as they relate to DELPH-IN goals.
Following is a list of participating groups that have been invited to
the Lisbon meeting, ordered lexicographically. If you find your name is
missing, please email standing *at* delph-in.net, the DELPH-IN Standing

Initially, most of the site-specific pages do *not* exist (or are
empty), i.e. wait for someone from the site to create the page and
supply some content. Note that most pages in the DELPH-IN wiki require
that users are registered with the server and have write access to the
pages they want to change (or create). The standing committee expects to
send out instructions on how to augment participant summaries sometime
in April (yes, 2005), but in case you are eager to fill in information
on your group, please contact info *at* delph-in.net.
