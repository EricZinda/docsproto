We discussed the advantages of treating a subordinator as a head vs. an
adverb. We agreed that when it occurs in the subord clause, the user can
decide if it's a head (attaching to S) or a modifier (attaching to just
VP or VP and S). However, when it's in the matrix clause, it should
always be an adverb (an the user can indicate if it attaches just to S,
VP or to VP and S). This has two advantages: first, we don't have to
make the initial symbol compatible with CP, and second we don't have to
distinguish between these Matrix CPs and those created by the yes/no
analysis for "ma" in Mandarin.

Further constraint of the adverb order must be added by the user in TDL
