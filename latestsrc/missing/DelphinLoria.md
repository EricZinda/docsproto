{% raw %}### Overview

[Langue et Dialogue](http://led.loria.fr/en_index.html) (LED) is a
research team directed by Patrick Blackburn at
[Loria](http://www.loria.fr/news?set_language=en&cl=en) (Laboratoire
lorrain de recherche en informatique et ses applications, UMR 7503) in
Nancy, France. The approximately 35 members of the team (including
research, teaching, and support staff, and graduate students) are
associated with one of two national research organizations:

- [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) (French National Institute for
Computer Science Research)
- [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/index.html) (French National Center for
Scientific Research)

or with one of the three universities in Nancy:

- [Université Nancy 1 Henri Poincaré](http://www.uhp-nancy.fr/)
(science and technology)
- [Université Nancy 2](http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/index.html?lang=EN)
(humanities)
- [INPL](http://www.inpl-nancy.fr/index.php) (Polytechnic Institute of
Lorraine).

The activities of LED include diverse grammar development efforts for
French (HPSG/LKB, LFG/XLE, TAG with metagrammars). The members of the
team are interested in using parsing and generation tools for developing
dialogue systems and for facilitating multimodal human-machine
interaction. Another research focus of LED is the standardization of
linguistic resources (lexicons, grammars, corpora, semantic
representations).
