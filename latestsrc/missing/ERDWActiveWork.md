- (*eric*) Propose a home for the documentation, including how search works
- (*liz*) Take the next step on building a prototype of conceptual docs that work for all audiences
- (*alexandre*)  Review [Perplexity Case Study Doc](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/blog/PerplexityOverview) and give feedback on it as a 
- (*all*) To move forward Since we're still ruminating on this notion of Tutorial vs. Reference it may make sense to have the group loop back and look at it with this perspective and see how the [Conceptual Prototype](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/ERDWErgSemantics_Essence) holds up. It may help with some of the objections or point to a version 2 of the prototype that gets it more cleanly in the tutorial camp.
- (*eric*) Dan proposed that we should do a second page on another phenomenon: eric will find one.  Dan suggested Relative clauses? 
- (? *francis* ?) Need a mockup of what our dream reference page *could* look like if we leveraged all the automated tools, databases, treebanks available to us.  It can use fake data, just needs to give us an idea of what we could do with a little work

Case Study Prototype
- (*francis* > 7/14): Deliver another case study prototype for: machine translation 
  - Perhaps a good example of the current problems
  - we have a tutorial: https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/MachineTranslationTutorial
  - which should but does not link to the detailed setup: https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/MtSetup
  - and none of these link to the Ace transfer page: https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/AceTransfer
    - I think the problem is no one has seriously done MT using DELPH-IN for a while, which is why there is no effort to keep the pages up-to-date, ...
