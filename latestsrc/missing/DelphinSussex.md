{% raw %}The [AI Research Group](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/) at
[Informatics, University of
Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/) hosts a natural language processing
research lab of around 20 researchers focussing on foundational aspects of NLP, software tools,
and applications.

Past work at Sussex related to DELPH-IN has included the
[RASP](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~johnca/rasp/) parsing
system for English (which supported Robust MRS output),
and the [COGENT project](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=GR/S24497/01) on
wide-coverage generation. John Carroll is currently working on further
development of the LKB system, and LKB-FOS in particular.
