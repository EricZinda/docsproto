{% raw %}# Background

The LAP Library is a software layer that helps interfacing between the
various LAP components, for example in acces to the LAP Store database
by processing tools (retrieving and recording linguistic annotations) or
by the Galaxy core (keeping the user history and LAP Store records
synchronized). Initially, the library is implemented in Python (as are
the tool wrappers, no matter the native implementation language of
various tools), but we want to keep open the possibility of providing
equivalent implementations in other common languages, e.g. Java, C++,
and Common Lisp.
