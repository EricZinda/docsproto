{% raw %}# Overview

[\[incr tsdb()\]](http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb) supports a variety of
processing modes, i.e. *parsing*, *generation*, *transfer*, and
*translation*. In general, processing results are recorded by virtue of
the following relations:

- *run*  information for a group of items, processed by one client
- *parse*  information
- *result*
- *edge*
