{% raw %}# Release 1.0 (October 2012)

37085 gold (36918 fully disambiguated)

of these, 27 silver confidence (t-confidence == 2), all fully
disambiguated

all export successfull and convert to DTM (note, the converter picks the
‘first’ reading from the file in case of remaining ambiguity)

6215 pseudo-derivations, of these only 5103 succeed in exporting (not
sure yet why exactly, but clearly there are many things that could go
wrong in the robust universe)
