{% raw %}## Norsyg - Norwegian Syntax-based Grammar

Norsyg is an LKB grammar for Norwegian. It is published under the MIT
license. It both parses and generates. Its lexicon (75,000 entries) is
mainly generated from the NorKompLeks dictionary, which
is an open source dictionary for Norwegian with argument frame
specifications for verbs.

The latest version of the Norsyg grammar can be downloaded from
[here](https://github.com/petterha/norsyg).

There is a [demo](http://eple.hvl.no/~phau/).

[This
site](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mvee8drlis9xfw5/norsyg-phd.tgz?dl=0)
has the version of Norsyg referred to in my
[thesis](http://ntnu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:232333).
