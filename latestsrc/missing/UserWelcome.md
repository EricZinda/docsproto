{% raw %}# Welcome to DELPH-IN

This page is intended as a map for users of DELPH-IN resources. This
includes annotated corpora, computational grammars, and associated
processing engines.

## Annotated Corpora

DELPH-IN resources include corpora for English and other languages which
have been annotated with elaborated syntactico-semantic structures via
the Redwoods treebanking methodology. These resources are available in a
variety of export formats.

### Treebanks

### Export Formats

For more information, see [ErsTutorial](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/howto/ErsTutorial) (slides, video)

### Treebank Processing Software

## Processing Stacks

In order to parse or generate further text with DELPH-IN resources, you
will need (a) a grammar, (b) a processing engine, and (c) associated
pre-processing tools.

### Distributions

- [ACE](http://sweaglesw.org/linguistics/ace/) for parsing and
generation, with associated compiled versions of the English
Resource Grammar; recommended for quick start
- The comprehensive [LOGON](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/tools/LogonInstallation) distribution for
parsing, generation and machine translation

TODO add links for:

- Recommended configurations for processing open domain text
- Information about input and output formats

### Grammars

Details about the full range of DELPH-IN grammars, including many small
experimental grammars, can be found on the
[GrammarCatalogue](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/grammars/GrammarCatalogue) page.
