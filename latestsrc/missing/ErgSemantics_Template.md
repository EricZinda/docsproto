{% raw %}# ESD Test Suite Examples

# Linguistic Characterization

# Motivating Examples

- Clear examples in cases of constructions difficult to differentiate
in some cases, e.g. instrumental relatives v. purposives
- Include negative examples: strings that seem similar a priori but in
fact do not represent the phenomenon. Such examples should help
clarify the boundary of the phenomenon in question.

# ERS Fingerprints

# Interactions

- Noteworthy interactions with other semantic phenomena (such as a
generator-input creator might need to know about); interphenomenal
well-formedness constraints

# Reflections

- Notes on composition or other further thoughts

# Notes on Generation

- Place to record observations about wellformedness requirements from
the generator's POV should we happen across any. (Optional section!)

# Open Questions

# Expert External Commentary

# Grammar Version

- Note the grammar version (trunk + svn revision) consulted as this
was written or updated.
