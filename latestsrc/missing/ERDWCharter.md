{% raw %}# ERG Reference Documentation Working Group Charter
This reflects what we think we are doing. Currently a draft, will be updated as we go.

Current working group members: Olga Zamaraeva, Dan Flickinger, Luis Morgado da Costa, Alexandre Rademaker, Francis Bond, Eric Zinda

## Goal
Increase ERG usage by providing documentation that allows a broader set of users to understand and use the MRS output of the ERG
- Broad community (non-linguists and linguists)
- Reduce reliance on limited # of subject matter experts
- Focus on practical usage of the ERG (e.g. Python + ACE + Grammar)

## Audience
Anyone who wants to build a system using the ERG
- Research
- Production
- Etc.

Must have computer science experience
- Documentation is focused on building a system
- Users capable of finding, installing and using the Delph-In Python library
- Users who could learn “challenging” languages (Haskell, Prolog, etc)

## Content
Conceptual/Overview material
- Variant of: https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/ErgSemantics
- Add linguistics background material (what is an event?)

Case studies
- How does one actually use the ERG?
- Description of the innards of working systems

Inventory
- The public interface: the MRS output
- Variant of:  https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/ErgSemantics_Inventory
- Look at the forum for gaps 

Grammar
- Nuts and bolts of how to edit the grammar
- Documenting the syntax so you can add your own rule would be very helpful, most eventually need this
- This is on Dan's plate, with this group (and others) as reviewers

Extension Points
- Parts of the architecture broadly that are ripe for enhancement and exploration by users
- parse ranking, lexical filtering for improving efficiency, etc

Tools and Processes
- How to use ACE?
- How to get a build?
- Who owns what in Delphin-land?

## Modernizing Tools
This group is going to collect and help prioritize enhancements that should help a broader set of users use the technology
- Falls out naturally as we survey, write about them, etc
- Need to figure out how to drive the fixes, maybe case-by-case

## Process
The ERG Reference Documentation Working Group (ERDG) is the “steering committee” and ensures:
- We are making progress
- We are going in the right direction
- Monthly meetings for a while?

Build a "Sustainable System" for documentation
- Simple and low overhead: Good enough
- Allows for broader contributions 
- Recognizes most information is held by a small group of experts
- Can continue beyond this point-in-time effort

The Process:
1. Create a list of topics to write on a public page
The list of "todos"
Documentation of the process, templates, and process for taking one on 
2. Allow contributors to sign up to write a first pass on each 
- Focus on good enough!
- Recruit a core group of experts
- …but anyone in the community can be a contributor

3. Author (or others!) can mark a topic for review
- "Needs technical review" and/or "Needs accessibility review"
- Accessibility (i.e. understandability by someone not practiced in the art of linguistics)
- Allows "editors" to search for docs that need a review pass
- Mark the doc as reviewed so future readers know who looked at it
