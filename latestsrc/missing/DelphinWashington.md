{% raw %}The [Treehouse](http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/) is Computational
Linguistics Laboratory in the [Department of
Linguistics](http://depts.washington.edu/lingweb) at [the University of
Washington](http://www.washington.edu). DELPH-IN related work at the
Treehouse includes development of the [LinGO Grammar
Matrix](http://www.delph-in.net/matrix) and the [the Montage
project](http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/Montage).

The LinGO Grammar Matrix, developed in collaboration with
[DelphinLingo](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/missing/DelphinLingo) and [DelphinOslo](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/missing/DelphinOslo), is a
starter-kit for the rapid prototyping of scaleable precision grammars.
Initial development of the Matrix was based on the [LinGO English
Resource Grammar](http://www.delph-in.net/erg/) and the [JACY Japanese
grammar](http://www.delph-in.net/jacy). Early versions of the Matrix
were used in the development of the
[NorSource](http://www.ling.hf.ntnu.no/forskning/norsource/) and [Modern
Greek](http://www.delph-in.net/mgrg/) grammars, and feedback from these
projects has spurred various refinements. More recently, development has
also been driven by the application of the Matix to a variety of
languages in the [multilingual grammar engineering
course](http://courses.washington.edu/ling567) at UW. Matrix-based
grammars are all compatible with the [LKB](http://www.delph-in.net/lkb)
and all map surface strings to MRS representations.

The Montage project, involving UW, Stanford, and MPI Leipzig, aims to
leverage recent advances in grammar engineering methodology and
technology to assist field linguists in the documentation of
underdescribed languages. The project pairs Matrix development with
coordinated work on tools to assist linguists with ontologically-linked
grammatical annotation of collected texts and the production of
linguistic resources in best-practice digital archival format. In
addition to benefitting from the DELPH-IN collaboration, Montage also
has links to the computer-assisted linguistics and language archive
communities, including [E-MELD](http://emeld.org),
[OLAC](http://www.language-archives.org), and the [Rosetta
Project](http://www.rosettaproject.org).
