{% raw %}This is a page for newcomers to the DELPH-IN community. Welcome!

Most of the information is already on the overview page, but this more
direct.

When you join, it can be a bit overwhelming. Some of the discussion may
be a bit detailed at first, but we would recommend you join:

- The [stack-exchange style forum](http://discourse.delph-in.net),
using the Discourse platform.
- The developers list ([DELPH-IN mailing
lists](http://lists.delph-in.net/)). If you click on a list, there
is a link to the archive near the top of the page.
- You are also encouraged to join the wiki: Please create a
[WikiName](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/docsproto/tools/WikiName) for yourself, which may require obtaining a
‘textcha’ to protect against wiki spam; once registered at the wiki,
to request write access please contact info *at* delph-in.net. We
hope that you will contribute to these pages over time.
