{% raw %}Notes on the session on intra-DELPH-IN communication and collaboration
(Kyoto, August 3, 2008. Scribe: [ScottDrellishak](../ScottDrellishak))

## Executive summary (added afterwards by EmilyBender)

- All are encouraged to make more active use of the mailing lists,
including \`developers' for bug reports/questions, as well as
actively using the wiki. ([BartCramer](../BartCramer) volunteered to do
general wiki-maintenance/moderation.)
- All are encouraged to send pre-submission papers to DELPH-IN members
at other sites for comments. (And if someone asks you to read a
paper, please reply with "yes" or "no" quickly, either answer being
socially acceptable).
- [RebeccaDridan](../RebeccaDridan) will make a tools section of the wiki
for sharing scripts that aren't ready for distribution through the
repository but possibly useful to other DELPH-IN members.

## Detailed notes

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- Everyone should put up their slides
- Most communication is on the mailing lists -- use them! Not much
traffic recently. Helpful to hear what other people are asking.
- You can subscribe to wiki pages.

[BartCramer](../BartCramer):

- There are many mailing lists, but not much traffic. Should they be
merged?

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- What was the rationale behind the different lists?

[StephanOepen](../StephanOepen):

- "participants" is people we invite to DELPH-IN activities.
- Others are purpose-driven, anybody can create them as needed.
- "developers" is the one for software/grammar engineering.
- We like to use "developers" for bug reports, feature requests, etc

[FrancisBond](../FrancisBond):

- Maybe we should merge "lkb" with "developers"?

[StephanOepen](../StephanOepen):

- But "lkb" is one of the higher-traffic lists and includes
non-DELPH-IN people, e.g. students in grammar engineering classes.

[ValiaKordoni](../ValiaKordoni):

- All communication should be done through the wiki using
messageboards.

[StephanOepen](../StephanOepen) and [RebeccaDridan](../RebeccaDridan):

- There are archives for the mailing lists:
[http://lists.dephi-in.net/](http://lists.delph-in.net/) -- through
they're not very convenient to search

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- It's dangerous to have too many lists.
- "developers" sounds like you have to be actively developing.

[StephanOepen](../StephanOepen):

- Everyone in the room should subscribe to "developers"

[ValiaKordoni](../ValiaKordoni):

- If you get too much email, it's easy to be overwhelmed.

[StephanOepen](../StephanOepen):

- But an annoucement in everyone's mailbox means everyone gets
informed.

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- But back to communication. How do we communicate what we're working
on?

[FrancisBond](../FrancisBond):

- Matrix list should be extended to general grammar questions.

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- Yes, it could be recast as a "delph-in grammars" list?

[FrancisBond](../FrancisBond):

- The important stuff should go on the wiki, but not \*everything\*.

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- Check the "recent changes" page on the wiki to know what's going on.
- Alternate suggestions: Rebecca (and somebody else whose name the
scribe garbled, sorry!) wanted a way for people to benefit from
other peoples' expertise without formal mentoring. They suggest
having a structure for sharing papers for review.

[RebeccaDriden](/RebeccaDriden):

- People can say, "I'm willing to read papers (though not EVERY paper
you send me)", then be sent pre-submission papers to read.

[HansUszkoreit](../HansUszkoreit):

- Send them to people who are closely related, but not co-authors.

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- DELPH-IN wants to increase its visibility at conferences (like at
ACL this year). Paper reviews will improve paper quality.
- People can always refuse -- it's best to reply "yes" or "no"
immediately.

[RebeccaDriden](/RebeccaDriden):

- Students could review as well.

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- Even the opinion of a reader from another sub-field is valuable.

[StephanOepen](../StephanOepen):

- Maybe distributing submissions to everyone in DELPH-IN is a good
idea. DELPH-IN does not have strict rules on communication.

[FrancisBond](../FrancisBond):

- But be careful, sending a submission to the "participants" list
means none of the the recipients can review it if they're reviewing
for the conference/journal.

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- Maybe by announcing the title and where it's being submitted allows
recipients to recuse themselves.

[FrancisBond](../FrancisBond):

- Is there any easy way to collect papers into a DELPH-IN bibliography
(like Stefan Müller's HPSG bibliography)?

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- Upload them to the wiki, including a .bib.

[StephanOepen](../StephanOepen):

- Is this library of papers for internal or external consumption? For
external purposes, maybe we only need links to institutions'
publications pages.

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- It's better to have it in one stable place rather than have it fly
by in email.

[FrancisBond](../FrancisBond):

- An up-to-date official external list on the web site would be nice.
- Unless someone is willing to volunteer to be Stefan Müller, it might
be too much work for now.

[RebeccaDriden](/RebeccaDriden):

- Tools: Rebecca has some tools that aren't ready for the wide world,
but could easily be shared internally. If you have such tools, put
them up on the wiki so other DELPH-IN people can use them. Put a
link on the wiki to wherever you have it stored (you can't upload
files to the wiki). There's no reason to duplicate effort!

[EmilyBender](../EmilyBender):

- After you put up your tool, send an announcement to "developers".

[FrancisBond](../FrancisBond):

- The criterion for whether a tool is useful to publicize is whether
you've shared it with a single other person. Once you do, put it up
and send it out.
