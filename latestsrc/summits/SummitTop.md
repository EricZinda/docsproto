Since 2005, [DELPH-IN](http://wwww.delph-in.net) has held an annual
Summit. This is a loosely structured
[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) where people
update each other about the work they are doing, seek feedback on
current work, and occasionally hammer out agreement on standards and
best practice.

## Planning Guidelines

### Physical Requirements

- One room that seats everyone, preferably set up for talks and
discussion;
- One or more other rooms for smaller meetings and breakout sessions;
- Good internet connectivity (there is a lot of live wikiing);
- Good microphone (Meeting Owl or similar) to pick up audio from in-person session for remote participants;
- In hot or sticky environments, air conditioning preferred;
- Access to nice coffee preferred.

### Timing

DELPH-IN Summits are normally held in summer, and are often co-located
with another conference (in the past, typically HPSG).

### Costs

In most years, there has been a participants fee, to cover local
infrastructure expenses, coffee breaks, and the like. We try to keep the
meetings cheap, to encourage student participation.

### Participation Policy

DELPH-IN Summit attendees can be:

- members of the 'participants' mailing list
- plus up to five nominated by local organizer
- ideally we should be able to have group discussions, hence about 30
people is a practical upper bound

### Program format

At the Kyoto meeting, we reflected on the format of the Summit, and
generally agreed on the following suggestions for future years:

- Three day core with a few days on either side (preferably
afterwards) for less formal time (with format varying depending on
whether the Summit is co-located with a conference)
- Split program chair and local host roles
- Local host can either manage virtual hosting or appoint a virtual
host for online participants
- Program chair solicit proposals for three categories:
presentations/updates, discussion, requests for tutorials, allowing
time for those agreeing to give tutorials to prepare ahead of the
Summit
- No parallel grammarian/developers sessions
- Internet access in the meeting room(s)

### Successful SIG scheduling

Some observations on making the scheduling of the SIGs go more smoothly:

- No individual should be responsible for more than N/2 SIGs, where N
is the number of SIG sessions they will be attending.
- If multiple SIGs are to be grouped into a single (serial) session,
this needs to be done before people indicate interest.
- SIG scheduler should lock the schedule page before beginning the
scheduling process.
