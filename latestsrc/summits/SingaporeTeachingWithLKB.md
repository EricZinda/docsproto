trollet as an alternative for emacs

Try to get students to come to class with laptops and go through
installation

- Need to have time to dedicate an entire section (or 2!)

Record demo for LKB

- Use [YouTube](/YouTube) Series of videos?
  
  - Whenever you learn something yourself, consider recording it
